function adjustMouseSensitivity(sensitivity) {
    document.onmousemove = function(e) {
        e = e || window.event;
        var x = e.clientX * sensitivity;
        var y = e.clientY * sensitivity;
        // do something with the adjusted x and y values
    }
}


This function takes in a sensitivity parameter, which is used to multiply the mouse's x and y coordinates. The adjusted x and y values can then be used to perform some action, such as moving an element on the screen.

You can call this function with a desired sensitivity value, for example:

adjustMouseSensitivity(0.5);
